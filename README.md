# Operating Systems Final Project

## Topic: Devlop/Simulate and Preemptive Scheduling Algorithm

### Problem Statement  
Currently prevalent round robin preemptive scheduling algorithms are not applicable in real 
time operating systems because of their large waiting time, large turnaround time, large 
response time, high context switch rates and less throughput. The primary aim of this project 
is to come up with a method for round robin scheduling which enhances the CPU 
performance in a real time operating system. The proposed algorithm for real time systems is 
a hybrid of priority and round-robin scheduling algorithms. It combines the merits of round 
robin, like elimination of starvation, and priority scheduling. The proposed algorithm also 
deals with aging by assigning variable priorities to the processes. Thus, the algorithm corrects 
all the limitations of round robin scheduling algorithm. We will also present a comparative 
analysis of our new algorithm with the existing algorithm i.e., round robin based on average 
turnaround time, average waiting time, varying time quantum and number of context 
switches.
